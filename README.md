### automated reserve
The automated reserve function is designed to allow users make a reservation before 7:30 a.m. daily, and the system will recommend the best choice according to the available parking spaces and the duration that all reserved users have applied for.However, there is always a time when you are not satisfied with the place we recommended. You are allowed to stick to your preferred choice as long as it is still available at that time, which may possibly cause to an unnecessary trouble to be disturbed for moving your car. We will then adjust our recommendation options to the following users.<br>
